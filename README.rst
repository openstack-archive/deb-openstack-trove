Trove is Database as a Service for Open Stack.


=============================
Usage for integration testing
=============================
If you'd like to start up a fake Trove API daemon for integration testing
with your own tool, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./tools/start-fake-mode.sh

Stop the server with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./tools/stop-fake-mode.sh


======
Tests
======
To run all tests and PEP8, run tox, like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox

To run just the tests for Python 2.7, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -epy27

To run just PEP8, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -epep8

To generate a coverage report,run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -ecover

(note: on some boxes, the results may not be accurate unless you run it twice)

If you want to run only the tests in one file you can use testtools e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m testtools.run trove.tests.unittests.python.module.path
