features:
  - Add support for full online backup and restore for DB2
    Express-C by enabling archive logging.
other:
  - In Mitaka release, support was added for full offline
    backup and restore using the default circular logging.
    In this release, the name of the strategy for offline
    backup and restore was changed from DB2Backup to
    DB2OfflineBackup. Hence, to enable offline backups, we
    should set backup_strategy=DB2OfflineBackup and for
    online backups, backup_strategy=DB2OnlineBackup. The
    property backup_namespace and restore_namespace will
    be the same for both types of backup and restore.
