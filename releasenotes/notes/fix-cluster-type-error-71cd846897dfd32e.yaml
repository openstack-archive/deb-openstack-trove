fixes:
  - This would apply to any type of cluster that uses the galera strategy
    while setting the nics on a create call. When we called cast to set()
    the object was a list of lists. The set method can not has a list so
    this was causesing a unhashable error. The change is to make the
    instance_nics a list of strings (what we originaly expected) to
    resolve this issue. Bug 1570602.
