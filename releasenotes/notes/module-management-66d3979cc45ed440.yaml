  - A new feature called 'module management' has been added to Trove.
    Users can now create, update, list and delete modules. A module is
    a file that is provided to Trove, and when a database instance is
    launched, that file is deposited on the guest instance. This feature
    can be used for depositing files like, for example, license files
    onto guest database instances.
