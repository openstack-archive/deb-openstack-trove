fixes:
  - Backups to Swift will now use Static Large Objects
    for larger backups. A new configuration option
    'backup_segment_max_size' can be set to adjust the
    segment size of the SLO. Backups that are smaller
    than the segment size will be uploaded as regular
    objects. This is an improvement over old Dynamic
    Large Object implementation. Bug 1489997.
