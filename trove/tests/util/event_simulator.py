"""
Simulates time itself to make the fake mode tests run even faster.

Specifically, this forces all various threads of execution to run one at a time
based on when they would have been scheduled using the various eventlet spawn
functions. Because only one thing is running at a given time, it eliminates
race conditions that would normally be present from testing multi-threaded
scenarios. It also means that the simulated time.sleep does not actually have
to sit around for the designated time, which greatly speeds up the time it
takes to run the tests.

Event Simulator Overview
========================

We use this to simulate all the threads of Trove running.
i.e (api,taskmanager,probocsis tests) All the services end
up sleeping and having to wait for something to happen at times.

Monkey Patching Methods
-----------------------
We monkey patch a few method to make this happen.

A few sleep methods with a fake_sleep.
* time.sleep
* eventlet.sleep
* greenthread.sleep

A few spawn methods with a fake_spawn
* eventlet.spawn_after
* eventlet.spawn_n

Raise an error if you try this one.
* eventlet.spawn

Replace the poll_until with a fake_poll_until.

Coroutine Object
----------------

There is a Coroutine object here that mimics the behavior of a thread.
It takes in a function with args and kwargs and executes it. If at any
point that method calls time.sleep(seconds) then the event simulator will
put that method on the stack of threads and run the fake_sleep method
that will then iterate over all the threads in the stack updating the time
they still need to sleep. Then as the threads hit the end of their sleep
time period they will continue to execute.

fake_threads
------------

One thing to note here is the idea of a stack of threads being kept in
fake_threads list. Any new thread created is added to this stack.

A fake_thread attributes:

fake_thread = {
    'sleep': time_from_now_in_seconds,
    'greenlet': Coroutine(method_to_execute),
    'name': str(func)
}

'sleep' is the time it should wait to execute this method.
'greenlet' is the thread object
'name' is the unique name of the thread to track

main_loop Method
----------------

The main_loop method is a loop that runs forever waiting on all the
threads to complete while running pulse every 0.1 seconds. This is the
key to simulated the threads quickly. We are pulsing every 0.1
seconds looking to make sure there are no threads just waiting around for
no reason rather than waiting a full second to respond.

pulse Method
------------

The pulse method is going through the stack(list) of threads looking for
the the next thread to execute while updating the 'sleep' time and the if
the 'sleep' time is <=0 then it will run this thread until it calls for
another time.sleep.

If the method/thread running calls time.sleep for what ever reason then
the thread's 'sleep' parameter is updated to the new 'next_sleep_time'.

If the method/thread running completes without calling time.sleep because it
finished all work needed to be done then there the 'next_sleep_time' is set
to None and the method/thread is deleted from the stack(list) of threads.

    This class simulates a coroutine, which is ironic, as greenlet actually
    *is* a coroutine. But trying to use greenlet here gives nasty results
    since eventlet thoroughly monkey-patches things, making it difficult
    to run greenlet on its own.

    Essentially think of this as a wrapper for eventlet's threads which has a
    run and sleep function similar to old school coroutines, meaning it won't
    start until told and when asked to sleep it won't wake back up without
