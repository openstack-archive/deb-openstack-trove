        The default PostgreSQL administration account is 'postgres'.
        This account always exists and cannot be removed.
        Its attributes and access can however be altered.

        Clients can connect from the localhost or remotely via TCP/IP:

        Local clients (e.g. psql) can connect from a preset *system* account
        called 'postgres'.
        This system account has no password and is *locked* by default,
        so that it can be used by *local* users only.
        It should *never* be enabled (or its password set)!!!
        That would just open up a new attack vector on the system account.

        Remote clients should use a build-in *database* account of the same
        name. It's password can be changed using the "ALTER USER" statement.

        Access to this account is disabled by Trove exposed only once the
        superuser access is requested.
        Trove itself creates its own administrative account.
